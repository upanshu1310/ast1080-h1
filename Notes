[12:00 - Football field] Set up the instrument and pointed towards the ground.
- Took 2 readings for the ground, 1 min and 5 min integration time (both of them showed similar features, only a small diference in power level. so we decided to take 60s integrations for further readings)
- Took 1 souce reading (Az 225, Alt 13)
- Took 1 sky reading pointed at the zenith, got an unusual bump at 1420.5 MHz.
- So we took 1 more sky reading pointing somewhere else (not zenith)  (Az 346, Alt 38)
